# Flashcard Quiz App

## Overview
This is a basic flashcard quiz app built with Kotlin in Android Studio. The app helps users study by answering a series of True/False questions. It tracks the score and gives feedback at the end of the quiz.

## Features
- Welcome screen with a start button
- Five True/False flashcard questions
- Immediate feedback after each answer
- Final score display with personalized feedback
- Review and Exit options on the score screen

## How It Works
- The app uses two parallel arrays: one for the questions, one for the correct answers.
- It starts with a welcome message. Pressing "Start" takes the user to the first question.
- Each question is answered using True/False buttons.
- Feedback is shown immediately after answering.
- The app uses a loop to go through all five questions.
- At the end, the score is displayed and a message is shown depending on the score.

## Screens
1. **Welcome Screen** – Introduction and Start button.
2. **Question Screen** – Shows one question at a time, with True/False buttons, feedback, and a Next button.
3. **Score Screen** – Shows final score, a feedback message, a Review button, and an Exit button.
